# Kuk Sool Research Repository

> Draft · Private Research Project · In Review

---

## Purpose

This repository is an ongoing study of **Kuk Sool** —
its history, terminology, people, organizations, and philosophical foundations.

It is being developed as a working archive and remains subject to correction,
review, and approval before any public release.

## Why This Work Matters

In martial training, we often speak of the future —
the next rank, the next generation, the next expression of the art.

In Korean, the word **미래 (Mirae)** means *future*.

But no practitioner steps forward without first understanding the ground beneath their feet.

An art survives not because it changes,
and not because it resists change,
but because it remembers.

To move responsibly toward the future of Kuk Sool,
we must understand its language,
its lineage,
its moments of unity and divergence,
and the people who carried it forward.

This repository exists to support that clarity.

---

## Personal Context

This research effort was rekindled through renewed training and discussion
within **United Mirae Kuk Sool (UMKS)** and conversations with senior instructors.

The emphasis on *미래 (future)* in that context prompted deeper reflection:
that responsible evolution requires historical understanding.

This work is offered independently and does not represent
an official statement of any organization.

It is offered first as a contribution —
in respect for teachers past and present,
and for students yet to come.

## Scope

This project includes:

- Historical notes drawn from primary and secondary sources
- Korean terminology with Hangul and pronunciation references
- Profiles of influential practitioners and teachers
- Documentation of organizational transitions
- Cross-referencing between major texts and traditions

Where accounts differ, those differences are documented rather than erased.
