# WKSA Leadership Transition and the Emergence of Mirae Kuk Sool

## 1. Context and Background

In Hyuk Suh, founder and long-time Grandmaster of the World Kuk Sool Association (WKSA), formally stepped back from his leadership position in early 2026. Widely regarded as one of the key figures in the modernization and global spread of Korean martial arts, In Hyuk Suh spent decades building WKSA into an internationally recognized system.

For many years, it was understood that his eldest son, **Sung Jin Suh**, would succeed him as Grandmaster. Sung Jin held a visible and respected role within WKSA and was considered the heir apparent.

However, in a surprising and historic move, Sung Jin Suh chose to depart from WKSA and eventually formed his own organization: **United Mirae Kuk Sool (UMKS)**.

## 2. Recent Leadership Announcement

In 2026, WKSA made a public announcement confirming the leadership transition:

- **In Hyuk Suh** formally retired as Grandmaster.
- **Choon-ok Harmon** and **Barry Harmon**, long-time senior masters, were promoted to **10th Dahn**, a rank historically reserved only for the grandmaster.
- Leadership of WKSA was officially passed to **Alex Suh**, the second son of In Hyuk Suh.

This transfer of leadership bypassed the traditional succession expectations and affirmed that **Alex Suh** would now serve as the organizational and symbolic leader of WKSA.

## 3. The Sacrifice and Vision of Sung Jin Suh

The absence of Sung Jin Suh from this succession marks a profound moment in Kuk Sool history.

- Rather than inherit the WKSA mantle, **Sung Jin Suh chose to walk away from the organization he helped build**, signaling a deep philosophical divergence.
- He founded **Mirae Kuk Sool** ("미래 국술" — *Future Kuk Sool*), under the banner of the **United Mirae Kuk Sool (UMKS)**.
- His move is now recognized not as a rejection of tradition, but as a **sacrifice in pursuit of something more inclusive and forward-looking**.

This act is significant:
- It underscores a desire to **preserve and evolve** the core techniques and values of Kuk Sool while expanding the possibilities for its practitioners.
- It reflects a **philosophy of leadership that prioritizes growth and change over inheritance and hierarchy**.

## 4. Implications and the Road Ahead

This moment in Kuk Sool history represents more than a leadership shuffle. It reflects a **division of paths**:

- **WKSA**, now under Alex Suh’s leadership, continues the legacy of the founding Grandmaster with established curriculum, hierarchy, and structure.
- **UMKS**, led by Sung Jin Suh, represents a **new direction** with an emphasis on modernization, transparency, and accessibility for future generations of martial artists.

For practitioners and historians alike, this is a pivotal moment worth close study.
