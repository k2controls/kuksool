  Research approach and principles used in the Kuk Sool Research Repository.

# Methodology

This repository follows a **practitioner-historian approach** to research.

The goal is not academic publication, but **faithful preservation** of
knowledge that is often transmitted informally.

---

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Respect Lineage
Lineage is documented carefully and respectfully, without editorial judgment.

Titles, ranks, and roles are recorded as they were held at the time, even when
later changes or divergences occur.

---

### 2. Separate Fact from Interpretation
- **Facts** are dated, sourced, and attributed
- **Interpretations** are labeled clearly as such
- **Personal observations** are explicitly identified

---

### 3. Preserve Differences
Where multiple traditions or organizations interpret history differently:
- Each perspective is recorded
- No single narrative is enforced
- The reader is trusted to evaluate

---

### 4. Language Matters
Korean terminology is:
- Presented in Hangul whenever possible
- Translated cautiously
- Linked to pronunciation tools (Naver)

Romanization is treated as approximate unless confirmed by a primary source.

---

### 5. Living Art, Living History
Kuk Sool is a **living martial art**, not a closed historical system.

This repository:
- Documents change rather than denying it
- Treats evolution as meaningful data
- Avoids freezing the art at a single moment in time

---

## Review Process

Content is reviewed in stages:
1. Author self-review
2. Senior instructor review
3. Lineage holder review
4. Broader practitioner or scholarly review (future)

Corrections are welcomed and documented.

---

## Limitations

This project acknowledges its limitations:
- Incomplete access to archival materials
- Reliance on oral history in some areas
- Ongoing evolution of organizations and leadership

These limitations are not hidden—they are part of the record.

---

## To Do

- [ ] Add explicit citation format guidelines
- [ ] Add versioning and change-log approach
- [ ] Add contributor guidelines (future)
