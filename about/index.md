# About Keith Kelly

This site accompanies my personal study and documentation of **Kuk Sool**, its
terminology, history, lineage, and philosophy. It reflects both my **martial
arts training history** and my current efforts to engage more deeply with the
art—physically, intellectually, and historically—during this new phase of life.

## Martial Arts Background

### World Kong Shin Bup Association (Hapkido)

I began my formal Korean martial arts training in the early 1980s and was awarded
the rank of **1st Degree Black Belt (Cho Dan)** in **Hapkido** through the  
**World Kong Shin Bup Association** on **September 1, 1986**.

This certification recognized me with the instructional title:

> **조교 (Ju Kyo)** — Assistant Instructor

### World Kuk Sool Association (WKSA)

On **June 30, 2001**, I earned the rank of **3rd Degree Black Belt (Sam Dan)** in
**Kuk Sool Won** through the **World Kuk Sool Association**, under the authority
and signature of **Grandmaster In Hyuk Suh**, founder of WKSA.

This rank is traditionally associated with the title:

> **부사범님 (Bu Sa Bum Nim)** — Assistant Instructor

My training during this period was based in **Traverse City, Michigan**, and was
rooted in the classical WKSA curriculum, including hyung, joint-locking systems,
weapons, and foundational philosophy.

## United Mirae Kuk Sool (UMKS)

As of **2026**, I consider myself aligned with **United Mirae Kuk Sool (UMKS)**,
founded by **Master Sung Jin Suh**.

While my affiliation is not yet formally recognized through UMKS certification
or rank confirmation, my intent to join and train under UMKS is sincere and
active. In personal conversation, Master Sung Jin has referred to me as:

> *“My Bu Sa Bum Nim”*

—a form of address that reflects mutual respect, shared lineage, and continuity
of training history.

> My current goal is to continue training, study, and contribution under the
> evolving vision of UMKS, which honors Kuk Sool’s foundations while intentionally
> looking toward the future (*미래, Mirae*).

Formal recognition, should it come, will follow practice, alignment, and time.
