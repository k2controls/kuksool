## Purpose

This repository exists to support a deeper understanding of **Kuk Sool** by
carefully documenting its **history, terminology, people, organizations,
and philosophical foundations**.

It is not intended as advocacy for any organization, nor as a critique of
others. Its purpose is **preservation, clarity, and continuity**.

## Motivation

In many East Asian traditions, there is a shared understanding that:

> *One cannot clearly see the future without understanding the path that led to the present.*

This idea appears repeatedly across Chinese, Korean, and broader East Asian
philosophical traditions—whether expressed through Confucian history,
Taoist metaphor, or martial instruction passed teacher to student.

A common teaching (paraphrased rather than quoted) is:

> *To know where you are going, you must first know where you have been.*

In martial arts, this is often conveyed more simply:

> *When climbing a mountain, you cannot choose the next step unless you understand
> the ground beneath your feet.*

For Kuk Sool—and for Korean martial arts more broadly—the **future (“미래 / Mirae”)**
cannot be responsibly shaped without:
- understanding the historical lineages
- documenting terminology accurately
- acknowledging moments of continuity and divergence
- preserving context that may otherwise be lost

This repository is an attempt to do that work carefully, respectfully,
and with humility.

## Scope

This project includes:
- Historical notes derived from primary and secondary sources
- Terminology with Hangul and pronunciation references
- Profiles of influential people and organizations
- Documentation of major transitions and lineages
- Cross-referencing between Dr. He-Young Kimm’s writings and later Kuk Sool texts

Where sources differ, those differences are **explicitly noted** rather than reconciled.

## Review and Collaboration

Content in this repository is being reviewed in stages:
1. Senior instructors and practitioners
2. Lineage holders and organizational leadership
3. Broader scholarly or practitioner review (future)

Feedback, corrections, and additional source material are welcomed during
the review phase.

AI-assisted drafting tools are used for structural and language support.
All content is human-reviewed and curated.

---

## Research Transparency

This project maintains explicit documentation of:

- [Sources](./sources.md)
- [Methodology](./methodology.md)

These pages outline the materials consulted, how conflicting accounts are handled,
and the principles guiding documentation and interpretation.

## Author

This research is being compiled by a long-time Kuk Sool practitioner as part
of a personal study project during retirement, combining physical training
with historical and philosophical inquiry.

The work is offered in a spirit of respect—for teachers past and present,
and for students yet to come.
