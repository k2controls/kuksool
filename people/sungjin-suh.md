## Lineage and Background

**Sung Jin Suh** is the eldest son of **In Hyuk Suh (서인혁)**, founder and long-time leader of the **World Kuk Sool Association (WKSA)**.

From an early age, Sung Jin Suh was deeply immersed in Kuk Sool training, leadership culture, and organizational life. For many years, he was widely viewed—both inside and outside WKSA—as the natural successor within the Kuk Sool Won lineage.

## Relationship to WKSA

Sung Jin Suh trained extensively within WKSA and held senior rank and responsibility within the organization.

At a pivotal moment, he chose to **leave WKSA** rather than assume leadership under its existing structure. This decision is widely regarded as a **significant personal and professional sacrifice**, as leadership succession traditionally follows senior lineage within family-based martial organizations.

This departure preceded a major WKSA leadership transition in which leadership was ultimately passed to **Alex Suh**, the second son of In Hyuk Suh.

## United Mirae Kuk Sool (UMKS)

Following his departure from WKSA, Sung Jin Suh founded:

> **United Mirae Kuk Sool (UMKS)**  
> **유나이티드 미래 국술**

### Meaning of *Mirae*
**미래 (Mirae)** translates to **“Future.”**  
In Korean usage, the term carries a broader philosophical sense of:
- forward direction
- responsibility to what comes next
- continuity with purposeful evolution

UMKS reflects an intent to:
- preserve Kuk Sool foundations
- move beyond rigid organizational constraints
- allow the art to evolve responsibly for future generations

---

## Vision and Philosophy

While detailed statements will be added as primary sources are collected, UMKS is generally understood to emphasize:
- instructor autonomy
- clarity of lineage
- technical depth over bureaucracy
- ethical leadership and personal responsibility

This vision represents not a rejection of Kuk Sool history, but a **re-centering of the art around purpose rather than hierarchy**.
