## Overview

**In Hyuk Suh** is the founder of the **World Kuk Sool Association (WKSA)** and one of the most influential figures in the modern history of Korean martial arts. Through WKSA, he systematized, standardized, and globally disseminated Kuk Sool, transforming it from a collection of traditional practices into a cohesive international martial art system.

He served for decades as **Grandmaster (대사부, Dae Sa Bu)**, overseeing curriculum development, rank structure, instructor certification, and organizational governance.

In Hyuk Suh has two sons who were both deeply involved in Kuk Sool:

- **Sung Jin Suh** (eldest son)

- **Alex Suh** (second son)

In late 2025 / early 2026, In Hyuk Suh formally **stepped back from active leadership** of WKSA.

Key elements of this transition included:
- Promotion of **Choon-ok Harmon** and **Barry Harmon** to **10th Dahn**
